## What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is a crucial phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) that involves gathering, evaluating, and documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software project. This process serves as the foundation for designing, developing, and delivering a product that meets user and business needs.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis plays a key role in ensuring project success by:

- **Understanding User Needs**: It helps identify what users truly need from the software, avoiding assumptions or misinterpretations.
- **Defining Clear Objectives**: It sets clear, measurable goals for the project, guiding the development team.
- **Reducing Risks**: By clarifying requirements early, it minimizes the chances of costly changes or project failure later.
- **Improving Communication**: It acts as a common reference point between stakeholders, developers, designers, and testers.
- **Enabling Better Planning**: Accurate requirements support effective resource allocation, scheduling, and budgeting.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

- **Requirement Gathering**: Collecting information from all stakeholders to understand their needs, expectations, and constraints.
- **Requirement Elicitation**: Using techniques like interviews, questionnaires, user observation, and workshops to draw out the actual requirements from stakeholders.
- **Requirement Documentation**: Clearly recording the requirements in a structured format such as a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document for future reference.
- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**: Analyzing the gathered requirements to resolve conflicts, identify dependencies, and model them using tools like flowcharts, data flow diagrams, or use case diagrams.
- **Requirement Validation**: Ensuring that the documented requirements are complete, clear, feasible, and aligned with stakeholder needs before proceeding to the design phase.

### Types of Requirements


- **Functional Requirements**: What the system should do (e.g., user authentication, data processing).  
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: How the system should perform (e.g., performance, security, usability).

## Use Case Diagrams
Use Case Diagrams are a type of behavioral diagram in UML (Unified Modeling Language) that visually represent the interactions between users (actors) and a system. They help to capture the functional requirements of a system by showing the different ways users can interact with it through various use cases.

### Benefits of Use Case Diagrams

- Provide a clear, visual overview of system functionality.

- Help stakeholders and developers understand system requirements.

- Facilitate communication between technical and non-technical team members.

- Serve as a foundation for creating detailed test cases and design specifications.
