## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a crucial phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) that involves gathering, evaluating, and documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software project. This process serves as the foundation for designing, developing, and delivering a product that meets user and business needs.

Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis plays a key role in ensuring project success by:

Understanding User Needs: It helps identify what users truly need from the software, avoiding assumptions or misinterpretations.

Defining Clear Objectives: It sets clear, measurable goals for the project, guiding the development team.

Reducing Risks: By clarifying requirements early, it minimizes the chances of costly changes or project failure later.

Improving Communication: It acts as a common reference point between stakeholders, developers, designers, and testers.

Enabling Better Planning: Accurate requirements support effective resource allocation, scheduling, and budgeting.

Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Requirement Elicitation – Engaging with stakeholders to extract their needs through interviews, surveys, workshops, etc.

Requirement Documentation – Recording the gathered requirements clearly in formats like Software Requirements Specification (SRS) documents.

Requirement Validation – Ensuring the documented requirements accurately reflect stakeholder needs and are feasible.

Requirement Management – Handling changes in requirements over the project’s life, ensuring traceability and consistency.

Types of Requirements

Functional Requirements: What the system should do (e.g., user authentication, data processing).

Non-Functional Requirements: How the system should perform (e.g., performance, security, usability).

Conclusion

Effective Requirement Analysis is the backbone of successful software development. It ensures that the right product is built in the right way, saving time, effort, and cost while delivering value to users and businesses.
